      <description>&lt;p&gt;Netflix&amp;rsquo;s recent international expansion has been aggressive and marked in comparison to its competitors. As streaming platforms from fellow media giants like Disney, HBO, and ViacomCBS swarm the market (taking back their licensed content with them), Netflix is leveraging its broad subscriber base and market dominance to explore a previously untapped global audience and create a vast library of original content in the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The unexpectedly brilliant goal won him the revered Puskas award that year and is widely regarded as Neymar’s arrival onto the international stage, poising him to be the next global superstar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
