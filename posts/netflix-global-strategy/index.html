            <p>Netflix&rsquo;s recent international expansion has been aggressive and marked in comparison to its competitors. As streaming platforms from fellow media giants like Disney, HBO, and ViacomCBS swarm the market (taking back their licensed content with them), Netflix is leveraging its broad subscriber base and market dominance to explore a previously untapped global audience and create a vast library of original content in the process.</p>
<p>Though the company has been famously opaque about how it quantifies the success of licensed and original content on its sprawling platform, a quick dive into its US region content library and how it has changed over the years can show us what’s been working on the platform and possibly provide us a signal to where the big, bustling world of streaming is headed.</p>
<h2 id="the-us-content-library">The US Content Library</h2>
<p>As an ad-free platform, Netflix relies on driving and sustaining subscriptions as its main source of revenue. With an increasingly saturated domestic market filled with competitors where it has already achieved significant market dominance <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, international markets show the most promise for future revenue growth. Since licensing and producing original content can be costly proposals, let’s look at <em>where</em> Netflix has put its money and what it may mean for its international expansion.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/cumulative_count.jpg"/> 
</figure>

<p>Looking at the figure above, we can see four distinct categories that the top 10 ‘countries of production’ fit into to: English-speaking countries, Western European countries, Spanish-speaking countries, and Asian-Pacific (APAC) countries. Though a country of production can be chosen with many factors in mind during a title’s development, a general idea of what languages and cultural ideas are being represented in the content may be a big contributing factor in that choice.</p>
<p>Looking back at the figure above, we can see an inflection point for internationally-produced content in 2016, which lines up with Netflix’s live announcement of ‘going international’ (#netflixeverywhere) on January 6, 2016 at the Consumer Electronics Show. The move expanded the platform to 150 countries with a promise of adding four more languages to the seventeen already supported at the time <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Since 2016, the US, UK, and India have been clear leaders of where Netflix content is produced. Though this may signal a preference for English-language titles in Netflix’s plans for both licensed and original content, it may also point to the fact that the US, UK, and India are homes to the largest entertainment industries in the world with sizeable pools of available content.</p>
<p>If we look outside the top 10 countries of production to a global map of all countries of production, we may be able to see an even more apparent international expansion plan in play.</p>

</figure>
</p>
<p>The highest cumulative content counts can be found in a few distinct countries, namely the US, India, UK, Canada, France, Japan, Spain, and South Korea. As a whole, these concentrations of numbers mostly lie in ‘affluent’ and ‘converging’ markets as defined by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. This could be because certain countries are positioned to have booming middle-classes in the upcoming decade and others are already considered affluent with large media-consumer bases. These two economic profiles seem to be where Netflix is zeroing in on to build a sturdy foundation for its international expansion. Possible other factors contributing to these decisions include countries with large entertainment industries with ready-to-be licensed content, the availability of affordable licensing contracts, and minimal  (regulatory, linguistic, and cultural) barriers to entry. But as Netflix’s budget for acquiring and producing global content expands, we may see new prominent ‘regions’ of content emerge from OECD-defined ‘stalled’ economies such as Mexico, Egypt, and Turkey some of which already produce a significant amount of content that is cross-culturally popular <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This being said, looking at the sheer numbers of titles being produced in each country is just one way to breakdown Netlflix’s international streaming strategy. Front and center of any interaction on the Netflix platform is genre – categories of titles that immediately show up during start-up. These genres are specifically catered to users’ viewing habits with the main purpose of helping them make a viewing selection within the first 90 seconds <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. When we funnel past countries of production and hone in on genre, we may be able to see similarities between regions in a way that could suggest Netflix leveraging algorithmically-uncovered trends between language- or culture-sharing region in its business strategy.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Expanding to a larger sample with the top 15 countries of production – and keeping in mind the previously demarcated regional categories (plus the new entry of the Middle East from the top 15) – we can see several commonalities of genre between countries within the same region.</p>
<p>Let’s first take a look Netflix’s genre breakdowns for movies. APAC countries, with the exclusion of India and Japan, have the most content in the genres ‘Action-Adventure’ and ‘Comedies’. This is in contrast to having ‘Dramas’ as the most commonly found highest-stake genre in the rest of the top 15. This trend of having the dominant share genre within ‘Dramas’, however, can be seen in India, a large APAC country where ‘Dramas’ and ‘Comedies’ are the first and second largest genre – similar to English-speaking, Spanish-speaking, Western European, and Middle Eastern countries represented. Japan’s produced content lies largely in ‘Anime’ but follows the APAC trend with ‘Action-Adventure’ closely following. Middle-Eastern countries share noticeable symmetry with each other with genres ‘Comedies’ and ‘Dramas’ as their largest stakes. This symmetry in dominant genres can also be seen with Spanish-speaking countries with ‘Dramas’ and ‘Comedies’, Western Europe with ‘Dramas’, ‘Documentaries’, and ‘Comedies’, and English-speaking countries where the symmetry is split between two groups with the US &amp; the UK in regards to ‘Dramas’, ‘Thrillers’, ‘Documentaries’, and ‘Comedies’, and Australia &amp; Canada with ‘Children &amp; Family Movies’ and ‘Documentaries’. Though there are some clear patterns for movies, it remains to be seen if similar patterns emerge in Netflix’s TV content.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/genre_15_tv.jpg"
         alt="TV Genre Breakdown by Country of Production"/> <figcaption>
            <p>TV Genre Breakdown by Country of Production</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Looking at the figures above, genre breakdowns for TV shows seem to follow less of a detectable pattern. ‘TV Comedies‘ share similar, sizeable proportions across notable countries in separate regions: US, Australia, Canada, China, and France. Some symmetry can be seen in the largest genres among two groups of countries, Mexico &amp; Spain (the two Spanish-speaking countries) and France and Canada, which do not fit into a common category. ‘Romantic TV Shows’ are far more dominant in APAC countries and when removing language-specific genre categories (e.g. ‘Korean TV Shows’), there are clear dominant genres in several countries, including ‘Anime Series’ in Japan and ‘TV Dramas’ in Egypt and Turkey.</p>
<p>These overall commonalities and symmetry suggest well-defined acquisitions and curation of content in regards to genre for international expansion. It further implies regional similarities in audience tastes that have been most likely uncovered by Netflix’s algorithm – a robust finding given that it ignores bucketing users into traditional demographic groups like geography, age, and gender, and instead relies on purely on what users watch and rate <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/genre_distribution_country.jpg"
         alt="Age Group Ratings Breakdown by Country of Production"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Age Group Ratings Breakdown by Country of Production</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And if we were to take a quick overview of the last metric available to us – content ratings and age groups of regionally-produced content for an expanded top 25 countries – we can see skewed distributions for most countries, except for the US, UK, Canada, and Australia which have more balanced profiles. This reflects the larger selection available for English-speaking Netflix audiences and suggests a longer, more informed period of curation for content from English-speaking countries as it is the main language of the country of origin of the platform (The US).</p>
<p>Given these insights into Netflix’s US content library, we can start seeing a pattern not only in English-language content, but also in emerging international markets. These findings can be a rich source of data on the streaming habits of millions of international users and may indicate where future investments in streaming may be, something we will look into next with Netflix’s own originally-produced content.</p>
<h2 id="netflix-originals">Netflix Originals</h2>
<p>Starting in 2013, Netflix has been steadily ramping up investment into original content – Netflix-produced titles that are permanently part of the library with no threat of being reclaimed by competing streaming platforms. Not only does it allow Netflix to increase control of its own content library, but also allows the data-driven development of ‘custom’ content that’s tailored to the tastes of its of large user base.</p>
<p>Looking into the Netflix original subset of its US content library, we can see a few similarities to the original superset, including originals content production being concentrated in similar countries (i.e. the US, India, UK, Canada, France, Japan, Spain, and South Korea). The ratings/age group metrics (by country) are similarly skewed like the overall Netflix US Library, but as of now there are no countries that have a balanced profile for all age groups with originals, indicating early stages of streaming platform content production that has not yet settled into balanced offerings for users.</p>
<p>Differences between Netflix originals and the whole of the Netflix US library really emerge when looking at the breakdown of title counts by type (movies vs. TV shows), duration of titles by type, and genre by country of production and type. Let&rsquo;s first look at the differences of titles counts for movies and TV between the entire content library and the originals:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Number of Titles by Percentage</th>
<th>Movies</th>
<th>TV Shows</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Entire Netflix US Library</td>
<td>70%</td>
<td>30%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Netflix Originals</td>
<td>25%</td>
<td>75%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We can see that Netflix has heavily invested in producing TV shows over movies for its originals. This could be for many reasons, including the nature of growing streaming revenue, which requires subscribers to continue their subscriptions and keep checking back in for new content, something that longer-running mediums like TV shows and miniseries can offer. It can also be noted that respondents in a recent poll have cited “hype” as a big incentive for subscribing to multiple streaming platforms <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. This “hype” has recently been seen for viral Netflix TV shows like Bridgerton, Tiger King, and The Queen’s Gambit but may be sustained less with shorter-duration movie offerings like Extraction and Birdbox. It remains to be seen if investing in movies can bring similar numbers to the streaming platform, but early investment patterns have shown that for Netflix, TV is king.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But let&rsquo;s take a look at the genre breakdowns for the Netflix original movies. Above the genre breakdowns for Netflix original movies have been narrowed down to a set of top 12 countries of production to adjust for the smaller number of titles.</p>
<p>Since Netflix movie originals are a small group at 35 titles, no real inferences on genre and/or regions can be reasonably made. But it is apparent that ‘Stand-Up Comedy’ is the largest and most dominant genre for movies in general which could be because stand-up comedy specials have relatively low production costs and may be easy vehicles of entry into international markets, both of which make them very attractive options for Netflix. This investment into stand-up comedy specials could also explain why the most frequent duration for movies dropped from 90-100 min. to 60-70 min. between the entire Netflix US content library and Netflix originals, whereas the most frequent duration of TV shows remained the same between the two groups at 1 season.</p>

         alt="TV Show Genre Breakdown for Netflix Originals"/> <figcaption>
            <p>TV Show Genre Breakdown for Netflix Originals</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now looking at the genre breakdowns for Netflix original TV shows (again with the top 12 countries of production), we can see a clear diversity of genre within TV originals which total 127 titles to date. Western European countries – France, Germany, and Italy – share some symmetry for their top genres. This can also be seen in the Spanish-speaking countries of Mexico and Spain. As for overall genre diversity, the US and UK remain at the top with India, an extremely promising emerging market with a large entertainment industry, being not far behind. Though these tenuous patterns are based on a nascent originals library, they echo the findings of the larger Netflix US content library that suggest a strategic approach to creating content based on linguistically-/culturally-similar regions, most likely powered by Netflix’s algorithm and data from its 200+ million large user base. What we can glean is a general trajectory not only for Netflix, but possibly for the entire streaming ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="what-it-means-for-the-world-of-streaming">What It Means for the World of Streaming</h2>
<p>Netflix’s international expansion has the potential to herald change in the way the entire world consumes media, not only with their own platform, but with the concept of on-demand internationalized content available to everyone around the globe.
With the data above, we get a sense of what genres of content are popular in certain regions and how Netflix and other streaming platforms may develop content tailored to those tastes. Along with regional specialization of genre, we can expect the global access to originally-produced content to allow certain genres to seep across regional lines in the global media landscape, making previously local genres international behemoths. Along with this ambitious, pioneering effort into the international media space, we can expect the profile of TV to rise as Netflix’s business strategy based on the simple goal of capturing and retaining subscribers drives content to be serialized and long-running. All of this, motivated by Netflix’s business goals and their powerful data-driven algorithm, points to rapid changes to the media landscape we’ve always known.</p>
<p>These changes might not only signal a change for the future of media but the rate of globalization as a whole. As consumers are increasingly exposed to other cultures through media, the nature of business and globalization is bound to change in unforeseeable ways. Netflix’s international expansion may not only be a force in globalization and democratization of media, but in the globalization and democratization of culture and language as well.</p>
